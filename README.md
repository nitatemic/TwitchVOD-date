# TwitchVOD-date

The name is really bad but the script is still useful. If you have ideas for a better name, don't hesitate to suggest them.


## Why did you make this script?
I missed a few streams from a channel. And when I wanted to watch them, I realized that having "X days ago" instead of the date of the stream was really not practical. So I thought it would be easier to put the date directly. That's exactly what the script does.


## I don't understand, can you show me an example please?

## Compatibility
It works with all modern browsers.
Personally, I have made it work on Firefox Developer Edition, Microsoft Edge, Safari and Safari Preview Technology.

I use AdGuard as my userscript manager but I also tested it with Tampermonkey
## Message to the people at Twitch
The script does not use the API, it only retrieves the title of the thumbnails to display the date. So it shouldn't be a problem for you but if it's a problem don't hesitate to contact me. And if you ever put this function directly on the site, it would be with great pleasure.
